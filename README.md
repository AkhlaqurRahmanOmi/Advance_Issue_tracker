## Advanced Issue Tracker (In Development)

This repository is dedicated to the ongoing development of the **Advanced Issue Tracker**, a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing issues in software projects. Built with **React.js** on the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express.js** on the backend, this application aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for developers and project managers alike.

### Project Goals:

- **Efficient Issue Tracking:**
  - The primary objective is to enable users to log, track, and manage issues with ease. The system will support categorization, prioritization, and assignment of issues to team members.
  
- **Real-Time Collaboration:**
  - The application will feature real-time collaboration capabilities, allowing teams to communicate and update issues as they arise. This is aimed at improving team coordination and project transparency.
  
- **Customizable Workflows:**
  - Users will be able to customize workflows to suit their specific project needs, including setting up custom statuses, transitions, and notifications.

- **Advanced Search and Filtering:**
  - An advanced search and filtering system will be implemented, allowing users to quickly find and sort issues based on various criteria such as priority, assignee, or status.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - The application will include a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.

### Current Status:

This project is currently in the development phase, with core features being actively implemented. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we work towards building a fully functional and polished application.

### Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-Time Features:** Socket.IO (planned)

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses towards its first release!
